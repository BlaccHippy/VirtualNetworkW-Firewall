# VirtualNetworkW-Firewall

## Objective
â€¢	Create and deploy virtual networks in Azure, then secure the networks by configuring a firewall that is located between the internet and the virtual networks.  ðŸ’»

### Skills Learned
â€¢	Configure and Deploy a Virtual Network for Web Server and a Virtual Network for Firewall which Logically segments networks 
â€¢	Create and Configure a Virtual Machine with RDP for remote access to web server, enable just in time access for VM
â€¢	Connect the two networks using Azure Network peering 
â€¢	Configure and deploy the firewall to run on virtual network created for it 
â€¢	Apply Rules to Firewall to protect Virtual Networks (ex. NAT, DNS, Application)

### Tools Used âš™
â€¢	Microsoft Azure VM
â€¢	Microsoft Sentinel
